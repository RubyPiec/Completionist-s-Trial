# Completionist's Trial

Do you like feeling like you've achieved something? Well, you're in luck! This game is all about achieving things!

This game is inspired by jmtb02's Achievement Unlocked, its sequels, and Goime 500 by Cary Huang.

The goal of this game is to get every achievement. Anything you do may count as progress towards an achievement. Try to:
- Jump!
- Walk!
- Explore!
- Click!
- Try things you wouldn't usually try!

This is a puzzle game, and a hint button will be added eventually.
